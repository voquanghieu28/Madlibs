# Madlibs

### 1. About the games
Madlibs is a fun word games where players will provide a set of words in different categories/topics, then the game will randomly generate an interesting or funny story :)

### 2. How to play (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs))
Mad Libs books contain short stories on each page with many key words replaced with blanks. Beneath each blank is specified a category, such as "noun", "verb", "place", "celebrity," "exclamation" or "part of the body".[11] One player asks the other players, in turn, to contribute a word of the specified type for each blank, but without revealing the context for that word. Finally, the completed story is read aloud. The result is usually a sentence which is comical, surreal and/or takes on somewhat of a nonsensical tone.
